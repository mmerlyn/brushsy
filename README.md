# ð“‚ƒðŸ–Š Brushsy: Your Canvas, Unleashed

## About the Project
Ever wish you had an endless digital whiteboard that just *works*? Brushsy is a modern, interactive drawing application built with React and TypeScript, designed to make your creative process smooth and intuitive. Whether you're sketching out ideas, taking visual notes, or just doodling, Brushsy offers a seamless experience across multiple pages, packed with smart tools and effortless management.

## What You Can Do (Key Features)

* **Dive into Diverse Drawing:** Pick your perfect tool from a versatile set including **Brush (B), Eraser (E), Rectangle (R), Circle (C), and Line (L)**. Need to move around? Grab the **Pan (H)** tool, or switch to **Select (V)** for future creative enhancements. Each tool is just a single keypress away!
* **Fine-Tune Your Strokes:** Get exactly the look you want by adjusting your brush's **`Size` (from a precise 1px up to a bold 50px)** and its **`Opacity` (from a delicate 1% to a solid 100%)**.
* **Unleash Your Colors:** Choose from a **beautifully curated palette of predefined colors**, or truly make it your own by picking **any custom shade** with the intuitive color picker. Your canvas, your colors!
* **Effortless Control & Quick Actions:** Mistakes happen â€“ easily `Undo` (`Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z`) and `Redo` (`Ctrl+Y` / `Cmd+Y`) your strokes, and `Toggle Grid` (`G`) visibility to keep everything aligned.
* **Infinite Page Management:** Never run out of space! Create, switch between, and manage an **unlimited number of distinct drawing pages**. A handy indicator always shows which page you're on (e.g., "Page 1 of 5"), making navigation a breeze.
* **Robust Creative History:** Feel free to experiment! Every page keeps its own **independent undo/redo history**, capable of tracking **over 500 individual drawing states**. Revert, refine, and iterate without fear.
* **Smart Export Options:**
    * **Quick PNG:** Export your **current active page as a high-fidelity PNG image** with a simple `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`.
    * **Full PDF Document:** Compile **all your whiteboard pages into one professional PDF document** (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`), perfect for sharing or archiving. Thanks to `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, your artwork looks just as good on paper!
* **Sleek & Responsive Design:** Enjoy a clean, intuitive interface that adapts beautifully to any screen size. All controls are right where you need them.
* **Personalized Theming:** Choose between a **crisp light mode and a comfortable dark mode** to match your workspace and preferences.
* **Performance that Keeps Up:** We've fine-tuned the canvas rendering by implementing `willReadFrequently` and optimizing drawing logic. This means **smooth, responsive drawing and interactions**, even when your canvases get packed with detail.
* **Dynamic Document Titles:** Give your masterpiece a name! Easily **edit and save the title of your artwork** directly from the top-left corner.
