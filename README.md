Brushsy is a modern, interactive drawing application built with React and TypeScript, designed to make your creative process smooth and intuitive. Whether you're sketching out ideas, taking visual notes, or just doodling, Brushsy offers a seamless experience across multiple pages, packed with smart tools and effortless management.

## What You Can Do (Key Features)

* **Drawing Tools:** Select from versatile tools: **Brush (B), Eraser (E), Rectangle (R), Circle (C), and Line (L)**. Navigate with the **Pan (H)** tool, or use **Select (V)** for future enhancements. Each tool is just a single keypress away.
